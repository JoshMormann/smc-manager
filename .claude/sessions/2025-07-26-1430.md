# Development Session - 2025-07-26 14:30

## Session Overview

**Start Time:** 2025-07-26 14:30  
**Context:** Recovery session after power loss, implementing session management system

## Goals

- [ ] Restore working build state (fix TypeScript export errors)
- [ ] Establish baseline functionality for SREF Manager application
- [ ] Document current state and recovery progress
- [ ] Set up session tracking to prevent future work loss

## Current Status

### Project Context

- **SREF Manager** - AI image generation style reference code management system
- React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS 4.0 + Radix UI
- Supabase backend with multi-provider authentication
- Recent work: Authentication fixes, testing infrastructure, validation improvements

### Critical Issues Found

- **Build Broken:** TypeScript errors due to missing exports:
  - `buttonVariants` not exported from `src/components/ui/button.tsx`
  - `toggleVariants` not exported from `src/components/ui/toggle.tsx`
- Components import these variants but they're not available

### Recent Git History

```
71d8041 fix: restore authentication functionality by wiring LoginScreen callbacks
f85a591 feat: implement comprehensive testing infrastructure and code quality improvements
b416095 feat: implement comprehensive Zod validation test suite
404f6bb feat: complete comprehensive codebase cleanup and optimization
af9f92b feat: implement granular image/tag diffing and type-ahead functionality
```

## Progress

### Analysis Phase ✓

- [x] Examined recent git commits and CLAUDE.md documentation
- [x] Identified build errors preventing development
- [x] Located variants definitions in `src/components/ui/variants.ts`
- [x] Confirmed variants exist but aren't exported from component files

### Recovery Phase ✓

- [x] Fix buttonVariants export - Added export to src/components/ui/button.tsx
- [x] Fix toggleVariants export - Added export to src/components/ui/toggle.tsx
- [x] Verify build passes - Build successful, 2.00s compile time
- [x] Test development server - Vite starts successfully on http://localhost:5173
- [x] Establish working baseline - **RECOVERY COMPLETE**

## Notes

- Session management system now in place to prevent work loss from power outages
- Architecture is well-documented in CLAUDE.md with comprehensive details
- All variants are properly defined in centralized variants.ts file
- Issue is simply missing re-exports from component files

## Recovery Summary

**SUCCESS:** All critical issues resolved and working development environment restored.

### What Was Fixed

1. ✅ **Build Errors:** Exported `buttonVariants` and `toggleVariants` from UI components
2. ✅ **Development Environment:** Build and dev server working correctly
3. ✅ **Session Tracking:** Established session management system

### Current State

- **Build:** ✅ Passing (2.00s compile time)
- **Dev Server:** ✅ Running on http://localhost:5173
- **Session Management:** ✅ Active tracking in place
- **Codebase:** ✅ Ready for continued development

## Next Development Priorities

With baseline restored, focus can return to core SREF Manager functionality:

1. Test authentication flow (email, Google, Discord OAuth)
2. Verify SREF code CRUD operations
3. Test image upload and management
4. Continue planned feature development

### Update - 2025-07-26 2:48 PM

**Summary**: Complete session recovery and build fix implementation

**Git Changes**:

- Modified: src/components/ui/button.tsx, src/components/ui/toggle.tsx
- Added: .claude/ (session management directory)
- Current branch: main (commit: 71d8041)

**Todo Progress**: 7 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending

- ✓ Completed: Create new development session file with current status and goals
- ✓ Completed: Set up current session tracking in .current-session file
- ✓ Completed: Fix buttonVariants export in src/components/ui/button.tsx
- ✓ Completed: Fix toggleVariants export in src/components/ui/toggle.tsx
- ✓ Completed: Verify build passes with npm run build
- ✓ Completed: Test development server startup
- ✓ Completed: Update session with recovery progress and findings

**Detailed Activity Log**:

1. **Session Recovery Setup** (2:30-2:35 PM)

   - Created session management directory structure
   - Initialized session file `2025-07-26-1430.md` with comprehensive status analysis
   - Set up `.current-session` tracking file
   - Documented power loss context and recovery goals

2. **Build Issue Diagnosis** (2:35-2:40 PM)

   - Identified TypeScript compilation errors blocking development
   - Located missing exports: `buttonVariants` and `toggleVariants`
   - Confirmed variant definitions exist in centralized `src/components/ui/variants.ts`
   - Root cause: Components importing variants but not re-exporting them

3. **Critical Fixes Implementation** (2:40-2:45 PM)

   - **src/components/ui/button.tsx**: Added `buttonVariants` to export statement
   - **src/components/ui/toggle.tsx**: Added `toggleVariants` to export statement
   - Both fixes resolve TypeScript error: "declares 'X' locally, but it is not exported"

4. **Environment Validation** (2:45-2:48 PM)
   - Build verification: ✅ Successful compilation in 2.00s
   - Dev server test: ✅ Vite starts successfully on http://localhost:5173
   - All TypeScript errors resolved
   - Development environment fully operational

**Technical Details**:

- **Before**: 4 TypeScript compilation errors preventing build
- **After**: Clean build with optimized production bundle (246.76 kB main chunk)
- **Impact**: Restored full development workflow capability
- **Architecture**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS 4.0 + Radix UI

**Recovery Outcome**: **COMPLETE SUCCESS** - All critical blocking issues resolved, development environment fully restored, session management system operational.
