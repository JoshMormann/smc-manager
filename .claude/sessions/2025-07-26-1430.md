# Development Session - 2025-07-26 14:30

## Session Overview

**Start Time:** 2025-07-26 14:30  
**Context:** Recovery session after power loss, implementing session management system

## Goals

- [ ] Restore working build state (fix TypeScript export errors)
- [ ] Establish baseline functionality for SREF Manager application
- [ ] Document current state and recovery progress
- [ ] Set up session tracking to prevent future work loss

## Current Status

### Project Context

- **SREF Manager** - AI image generation style reference code management system
- React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS 4.0 + Radix UI
- Supabase backend with multi-provider authentication
- Recent work: Authentication fixes, testing infrastructure, validation improvements

### Critical Issues Found

- **Build Broken:** TypeScript errors due to missing exports:
  - `buttonVariants` not exported from `src/components/ui/button.tsx`
  - `toggleVariants` not exported from `src/components/ui/toggle.tsx`
- Components import these variants but they're not available

### Recent Git History

```
71d8041 fix: restore authentication functionality by wiring LoginScreen callbacks
f85a591 feat: implement comprehensive testing infrastructure and code quality improvements
b416095 feat: implement comprehensive Zod validation test suite
404f6bb feat: complete comprehensive codebase cleanup and optimization
af9f92b feat: implement granular image/tag diffing and type-ahead functionality
```

## Progress

### Analysis Phase ‚úì

- [x] Examined recent git commits and CLAUDE.md documentation
- [x] Identified build errors preventing development
- [x] Located variants definitions in `src/components/ui/variants.ts`
- [x] Confirmed variants exist but aren't exported from component files

### Recovery Phase ‚úì

- [x] Fix buttonVariants export - Added export to src/components/ui/button.tsx
- [x] Fix toggleVariants export - Added export to src/components/ui/toggle.tsx
- [x] Verify build passes - Build successful, 2.00s compile time
- [x] Test development server - Vite starts successfully on http://localhost:5173
- [x] Establish working baseline - **RECOVERY COMPLETE**

## Notes

- Session management system now in place to prevent work loss from power outages
- Architecture is well-documented in CLAUDE.md with comprehensive details
- All variants are properly defined in centralized variants.ts file
- Issue is simply missing re-exports from component files

## Recovery Summary

**SUCCESS:** All critical issues resolved and working development environment restored.

### What Was Fixed

1. ‚úÖ **Build Errors:** Exported `buttonVariants` and `toggleVariants` from UI components
2. ‚úÖ **Development Environment:** Build and dev server working correctly
3. ‚úÖ **Session Tracking:** Established session management system

### Current State

- **Build:** ‚úÖ Passing (2.00s compile time)
- **Dev Server:** ‚úÖ Running on http://localhost:5173
- **Session Management:** ‚úÖ Active tracking in place
- **Codebase:** ‚úÖ Ready for continued development

## Next Development Priorities

With baseline restored, focus can return to core SREF Manager functionality:

1. Test authentication flow (email, Google, Discord OAuth)
2. Verify SREF code CRUD operations
3. Test image upload and management
4. Continue planned feature development

- **Production Build:** Optimized bundle (246.76 kB main chunk)
- **Clean Architecture:** Maintained centralized variant system in `variants.ts`

### Features Implemented

1. **Session Management Commands:**

   - `/project:session-start` - Initialize new development sessions
   - `/project:session-update` - Log progress and findings
   - `/project:session-end` - Complete session with comprehensive summary
   - `/project:session-current` - Check active session status
   - `/project:session-list` - View all session files
   - `/project:session-help` - Command documentation

2. **Recovery Infrastructure:**
   - Automated session file generation with timestamp naming
   - Git integration for tracking code changes
   - Todo list progress monitoring
   - Comprehensive activity logging

### Problems Encountered & Solutions

#### **Problem:** TypeScript Build Failures

- **Issue:** Components importing variants but variants not exported from component files
- **Root Cause:** Missing re-exports in `button.tsx` and `toggle.tsx`
- **Solution:** Added `buttonVariants` and `toggleVariants` to export statements
- **Impact:** Restored full development workflow capability

#### **Problem:** Power Outage Work Loss Risk

- **Issue:** Previous development session lost due to power failure
- **Solution:** Implemented comprehensive session management system
- **Prevention:** Active session tracking with detailed documentation

### Dependencies & Configuration

**No New Dependencies Added** - Used existing project stack:

- React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS 4.0 + Radix UI
- Supabase (backend/auth)
- ESLint + Prettier (code quality)

**Configuration Changes:**

- Added `.claude/` directory structure for session management
- Integrated session commands with existing development workflow

### Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are additive and backward compatible

### Important Findings

1. **Centralized Variant System:** All UI variants properly organized in `src/components/ui/variants.ts`
2. **Export Pattern:** Components must re-export variants for external consumption
3. **Build Process:** TypeScript compilation runs before Vite build
4. **Session Management:** Prevents work loss and improves development continuity

### Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation is Critical:** Comprehensive session logs enable quick recovery
2. **Export Consistency:** Always verify component exports match import requirements
3. **Incremental Commits:** Regular commits with descriptive messages aid debugging
4. **System Redundancy:** Session management provides essential backup for development state

### What Wasn't Completed

**All session objectives achieved.** Future development can proceed with:

1. Authentication flow testing (email, Google, Discord OAuth)
2. SREF code CRUD operations verification
3. Image upload and management testing
4. New feature development

### Tips for Future Developers

1. **Use Session Commands:** Start sessions with `/project:session-start` for important work
2. **Regular Updates:** Use `/project:session-update` to log significant findings
3. **Build Verification:** Always run `npm run build` after UI component changes
4. **Export Patterns:** Check variant exports when adding new UI components
5. **Recovery Protocol:** Session files contain complete context for quick problem resolution

### Next Development Priorities

With baseline fully restored:

1. Verify authentication system functionality
2. Test core SREF management features
3. Validate image upload/storage workflows
4. Continue planned feature development

**Session completed successfully - All critical issues resolved, development environment operational, session management system active.**
