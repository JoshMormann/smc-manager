### Recent Accomplishments

- âœ… **Enhanced SREF Card UI**: Implemented pixel-perfect Figma design specifications

## Progress

### Session Setup âœ“

- [x] Create new development session file
- [x] Set up current session tracking
- [x] Document continuation context

### Menu Button Fix âœ“

- [x] **Issue Identified**: Hover overlay z-index blocking menu button clicks
- [x] **Root Cause**: Hover overlay (`z-20`) positioned above menu button (`z-10`)
- [x] **Solution Applied**: Lowered hover overlay to `z-5`, cleaned up event handlers
- [x] **Verification**: Menu button now works correctly without affecting card functionality

### Technical Details

**Problem**: When clicking three-dot menu button, card's copy behavior triggered instead of dropdown
**Debug Process**: Systematic testing of Framer Motion, event handlers, and z-index layering
**Final Fix**: Changed hover overlay from `z-20` to `z-5` in SREFCard.tsx:375
