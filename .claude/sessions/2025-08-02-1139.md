### Todo Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 0 (discussion-only session)
- **Completed**: N/A
- **Remaining**: N/A

### Key Accomplishments

- **Strategic Planning**: Discussed Chrome extension concept for seamless SREF mining from MidJourney
- **Architecture Decision**: Recommended separate repository vs subfolder approach
- **Technical Roadmap**: Outlined 5-phase development plan
- **Design Requirements**: Defined needed design files and UI components
- **PRD Planning**: Structured comprehensive Product Requirements Document outline

### Features Discussed

- **Chrome Extension Core**: Auto-detection of SREF codes on MidJourney pages
- **UI Integration**: Hammer/pick icons injected into SREF result chips
- **One-Click Mining**: Popup naming interface with automatic capture
- **Backend Integration**: OAuth authentication with existing Supabase backend
- **Seamless Workflow**: Direct sync to SMC Manager library

### Technical Recommendations

- **Project Structure**: Separate repository or monorepo approach
- **Technology Stack**: Chrome Extension Manifest V3, TypeScript, content scripts
- **Authentication**: OAuth flow with Supabase backend
- **Data Flow**: Content script → Background script → SMC Manager API
- **Integration Points**: Existing SREFCodeService, code-images bucket, data models

### Design Requirements Identified

- Icon designs (hammer/pick, extension icons)
- Modal/popup interfaces
- User flow mockups
- Style guide alignment with SMC Manager
- Error handling and loading states

### Strategic Insights

- **Content Seeding Strategy**: Use extension to populate discovery feed while building
- **Market Differentiation**: Create unique "mine-to-manage" workflow
- **Launch Preparation**: Build content library alongside development
- **User Experience**: Seamless bridge between MidJourney and SMC Manager

### What Wasn't Completed

- No code implementation (planning session only)
- Design files not created (user will handle)
- PRD document not written (planned for future)
- Repository not created (scheduled for Monday)

### Next Steps

- User to create design files and design system tokens
- User to finish Figma design updates
- Create GitHub repository for extension
- Implement PRD in new repository
- Begin development Monday with complete planning foundation

### Dependencies

- **Design Dependencies**: UI mockups, icon designs, style guide
- **Infrastructure**: New GitHub repository setup
- **Documentation**: PRD creation and technical specifications

### Lessons Learned

- Strategic planning sessions valuable for complex feature discussions
- Separate repository approach better for different deployment targets
- Content seeding strategy critical for successful product launch
- Integration planning essential before development begins

### Tips for Future Developers

- Review existing SMC Manager authentication and API patterns
- Study MidJourney DOM structure for injection points
- Consider Chrome extension security and permissions carefully
- Plan for offline capabilities and error handling
- Design for seamless user experience across both platforms
